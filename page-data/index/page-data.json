TensorFlow was lauded for ease, flexibility, and GPU support. ResNet, a powerful deep learning architecture, handled data preprocessing and classification effectively. The results of this model were a loss of under 1% on training data and an accuracy of 89% on validation data. This was my bachelor project ","link":"https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Xv-1aiAlIM7m1hw7PKVCav5Aw5t8arAX?usp=sharing"},{"name":"Music Genre Classification","description":"Built a robust music genre classifier using VGG19, Keras, and signal processing. It extracted audio features, generated spectrograms, and trained a model for precise 10-genre categorization. This classifier facilitated music collection organization, personalized recommendations, and adaptable streaming platforms through audio analysis and deep learning fusion. The results of this model were 80% accuracy on training data and 61% accuracy on validation data. I worked on this project to improve my classification and NLP skills.","link":"https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1GHWM2DRkMD3Dr1yN21S4-HvO7GrJpeas?usp=sharing"},{"name":"Predict Car Prices With k-Nearest Neighbor","description":" k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) was used to predict car prices based on quality. It worked by comparing a cars attributes and quality to similar cars and estimating its cost. This method helped assess car valuations for buying or selling, providing insights into fair market values based on quality. The result of this model was 90% accuracy on validation data.
